This restoration verifies the backup\u2019s integrity and the restoration process\u2019s functionality. Monitor Backup Reports Regularly review backup reports and logs for any errors or failures during the backup process. This can help identify issues early before they become critical problems. Check for Data Consistency Compare the original data with the backed-up data to ensure consistency. This can be done by checking file sizes, using checksums, or employing other data validation techniques. One tool would be to use [<code>pt-table-checksum</code>]. Simulate Disaster Scenarios Conducting a simulated disaster recovery exercise can help determine how well your backup system will perform under stress and identify any gaps in your recovery plan. Audit Backup Procedures Regular audits of the backup procedures can ensure that the backups are being performed in accordance with the established policies and that the backup system is functioning as expected. Validate Backup Configuration Ensure that the backup configuration is correct and that all necessary data is being backed up. This includes checking backup schedules, retention policies, and the scope of the data backed up. Verify Security Measures Confirm that the backup data is secure and that encryption and other security measures are functioning correctly to protect against unauthorized access. Evaluate Recovery Time Objectives Measure how long it takes to restore data from backups and compare this with your recovery time objectives to ensure they align with your business requirements. Assess Backup Media Reliability Regularly check the physical and logical condition of the backup media, whether it\u2019s tape, disk, or cloud storage, to ensure it\u2019s in good working order. Conduct Incremental Backup Tests Test the restoration of incremental backups to ensure that they work in conjunction with full backups and that the data can be restored to a specific point in time. Review Backup Software Updates Keep the backup software updated and test after updates to ensure new versions or patches do not introduce issues with the backup or restoration processes. Check for Compatibility Issues Ensure that the backup system is compatible with all the software and data formats used in your organization to avoid restoration issues. Document Test Results Keep detailed records of all backup tests, including the scope, date, issues encountered, and resolutions. This documentation can be invaluable for troubleshooting and improving the backup process. <p>By implementing these methods, you are confident that your backup system protects your data and can recover your data when necessary. Regular testing and monitoring are key to maintaining an effective backup strategy and ensuring business continuity. Remember, the goal of testing is not just to prove that backups can be restored, but to identify and resolve any issues before an actual disaster occurs. This proactive approach can save valuable time and resources, and ultimately, safeguard your organization\u2019s data integrity.</p>"},{"location":"backup-strategy.html#common-challenges","title":"Common challenges","text":"<p>Common backup challenges often include issues such as damaged backups, missing or failed backups, maintaining legacy systems, adhering to strict privacy and security regulations, and managing the costs associated with data backup. To overcome these challenges, organizations can adopt several strategies. Implementing a modern, reliable backup solution that includes automated data consistency checking can help protect against damaged backups. Regular recovery tests can ensure that data is recoverable and not corrupt.</p> <p>For missing or failed backups, it\u2019s essential to have a robust monitoring system that alerts IT staff to any issues with the backup process. This allows for immediate action to rectify any problems before they escalate.

Logical backups focus on the data structure and SQL statements, and you can back up a selected set of data or exclude specific data during the export, saving time and storage. They contain only structural information about the database, not instance-specific details. Logical backups are slower than physical backups because of the SQL parsing and execution. A logical backup does not preserve the file system-level security settings, user accounts, privileges, or authentication settings. During restoration, you must manually reconfigure these settings.</p> <p>You can restore a logical backup on any other machine and in different environments. Logical backups provide granular recovery capabilities to restore specific components, such as individual tables or schemas. The recovery process can be more difficult because it involves recreating the entire data structure. Use logical backups when restoring or moving a database copy to another environment. They are an option for platform-independent data migration.</p> <p>Unlike physical backups, logical backups are less secure because the data is unencrypted. Anyone with access to the backup could read sensitive information. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"differences.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p>"},{"location":"docker.html","title":"Run Percona XtraBackup 8.0 in a Docker container","text":"<p>Docker containers are built from Docker images, which are snapshots of the configuration needed to run an applications, such as the code, and libraries.

It copies your InnoDB data files, which results in data that is internally inconsistent; but then it performs crash recovery on the files to make them a consistent, usable database again.</p> <p>This works because InnoDB maintains a redo log, also called the transaction log. This contains a record of every change to InnoDB data. When InnoDB starts, it inspects the data files and the transaction log, and performs two steps. It applies committed transaction log entries to the data files, and it performs an undo operation on any transactions that modified data but did not commit.</p> <p>Percona XtraBackup 8.0.30-23 adds the \u2013register-redo-log-consumer parameter. This parameter is disabled by default. When enabled, the parameter lets Percona XtraBackup register as a redo log consumer at the start of the backup. The server does not remove a redo log that Percona XtraBackup (the consumer) has not yet copied. The consumer reads the redo log and manually advances the log sequence number (LSN). The server blocks the writes during the process. Based on the redo log consumption, the server determines when it can purge the log.</p> <p>Percona XtraBackup works by remembering the LSN when it starts, and then copying away the data files. It takes some time to do this, so if the files are changing, then they reflect the state of the database at different points in time. At the same time, Percona XtraBackup runs a background process that watches the transaction log files, and copies changes from it. Percona XtraBackup needs to do this continually because the transaction logs are written in a round-robin fashion, and can be reused after a while. Percona XtraBackup needs the transaction log records for every change to the data files since it began execution.</p> <p>Percona XtraBackup uses Backup locks</p> <p>where available as a lightweight alternative to <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code>. This feature is available in Percona Server for MySQL 5.6+. MySQL 8.0 allows acquiring an instance level backup lock via the <code>LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP</code> statement.</p> <p>Locking is only done for MyISAM and other non-InnoDB tables after Percona XtraBackup finishes backing up all InnoDB/XtraDB data and logs. Percona XtraBackup uses this automatically to copy non-InnoDB data to avoid blocking DML queries that modify InnoDB tables.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>The <code>BACKUP_ADMIN</code> privilege is required to query the  <code>performance_schema_log_status</code> for either <code>LOCK  INSTANCE FOR BACKUP</code> or <code>LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP</code>.</p> <p>xtrabackup tries to avoid backup locks and <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> when the instance contains only InnoDB tables. In this case, xtrabackup obtains binary log coordinates from <code>performance_schema.log_status</code>. <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> is still required in MySQL 8.0 when xtrabackup is started with the <code>--slave-info</code>. The <code>log_status</code> table in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 is extended to include the relay log coordinates, so no locks are needed even with the <code>--slave-info</code> option.</p> <p>See also</p> <p>MySQL Documentation: LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP</p> <p>When backup locks are supported by the server, xtrabackup first copies InnoDB data, runs the <code>LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP</code> and then copies the MyISAM tables. Once this is done, the backup of the files will begin. It will backup .frm, .MRG, .MYD, .MYI, .CSM, .CSV, <code>.sdi</code> and <code>.par</code> files.</p> <p>After that xtrabackup will use <code>LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP</code> to block all operations that might change either binary log position or <code>Exec_Master_Log_Pos</code> or <code>Exec_Gtid_Set</code> (i.e. source binary log coordinates corresponding to the current SQL thread state on a replication replica) as reported by <code>SHOW MASTER/SLAVE STATUS</code>. xtrabackup will then finish copying the REDO log files and fetch the binary log coordinates. After this is completed xtrabackup will unlock the binary log and tables.</p> <p>Finally, the binary log position will be printed to <code>STDERR</code> and xtrabackup will exit returning 0 if all went OK.</p> <p>Note that the <code>STDERR</code> of xtrabackup is not written in any file. You will have to redirect it to a file, e.g., <code>xtrabackup OPTIONS 2&gt; backupout.log</code>.</p> <p>It will also create the following files in the directory of the backup.</p> <p>During the <code>prepare</code> phase, Percona XtraBackup performs crash recovery against the copied data files, using the copied transaction log file. After this is done, the database is ready to restore and use.</p> <p>The backed-up MyISAM and InnoDB tables will be eventually consistent with each other, because after the prepare (recovery) process, InnoDB\u2019s data is rolled forward to the point at which the backup completed, not rolled back to the point at which it started. This point in time matches where the <code>FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK</code> was taken, so the MyISAM data and the prepared InnoDB data are in sync.</p> <p>The xtrabackup offers many features not mentioned in the preceding explanation. The functionality of each tool is explained in more detail further in this manual. In brief, though, the tools enable you to do operations such as streaming and incremental backups with various combinations of copying the data files, copying the log files, and applying the logs to the data.</p>"},{"location":"how-xtrabackup-works.html#restoring-a-backup","title":"Restoring a backup","text":"<p>To restore a backup with xtrabackup you can use the \u2013copy-back or \u2013move-back options.</p> <p>xtrabackup will read from the <code>my.cnf</code> the variables datadir, innodb_data_home_dir, innodb_data_file_path, innodb_log_group_home_dir and check that the directories exist.</p> <p>It will copy the MyISAM tables, indexes, etc. (.MRG, .MYD, .MYI, .CSM, .CSV, <code>.sdi</code>, and <code>par</code> files) first, InnoDB tables and indexes next and the log files at last.

If you restore it and start MySQL, InnoDB will detect that the rollback phase was not performed, and it will do that in the background, as it usually does for a crash recovery upon start. It will notify you that the database was not shut down normally.</p> <p>To apply the first incremental backup to the full backup, run the following command:</p> <pre><code>$ xtrabackup --prepare --apply-log-only --target-dir=/data/backups/base \\\n--incremental-dir=/data/backups/inc1\n</code></pre> <p>This applies the delta files to the files in <code>/data/backups/base</code>, which rolls them forward in time to the time of the incremental backup. It then applies the redo log as usual to the result. The final data is in <code>/data/backups/base</code>, not in the incremental directory. You should see an output similar to:</p> Expected output <pre><code>incremental backup from 1626007 is enabled.\nxtrabackup: cd to /data/backups/base\nxtrabackup: This target seems to be already prepared with --apply-log-only.\nxtrabackup: xtrabackup_logfile detected: size=2097152, start_lsn=(4124244)\n...\nxtrabackup: page size for /tmp/backups/inc1/ibdata1.delta is 16384 bytes\nApplying /tmp/backups/inc1/ibdata1.delta to ./ibdata1...\n...\n161011 12:45:56 completed OK!\n</code></pre> <p>Again, the LSN should match what you saw from your earlier inspection of the first incremental backup. If you restore the files from <code>/data/backups/base</code>, you should see the state of the database as of the first incremental backup.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Percona XtraBackup does not support using the same incremental backup directory to prepare two copies of backup. Do not run <code>--prepare</code> with the same incremental backup directory (the value of \u2013incremental-dir) more than once.</p> <p>Preparing the second incremental backup is a similar process: apply the deltas to the (modified) base backup, and you will roll its data forward in time to the point of the second incremental backup:</p> <pre><code>$ xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/data/backups/base \\\n--incremental-dir=/data/backups/inc2\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p><code>--apply-log-only</code> should be used when merging the incremental backups except the last one. That\u2019s why the previous line does not contain the <code>--apply-log-only</code> option. Even if the <code>--apply-log-only</code> was used on the last step, backup would still be consistent but in that case server would perform the rollback phase.</p> <p>Once prepared incremental backups are the same as the full backups, and they can be restored in the same way.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"prepare-incremental-backup.html#get-expert-help","title":"Get expert help","text":"<p>If you need assistance, visit the community forum for comprehensive and free database knowledge, or contact our Percona Database Experts for professional support and services.</p> <p> Community Forum  Get a Percona Expert</p>"},{"location":"prepare-individual-partitions-backup.html","title":"Prepare an individual partitions backup","text":"<p>For preparing partial backups, the procedure is analogous to restoring individual tables.

Percona XtraBackup can produce inconsistent backups with this option enabled.

This version makes <code>ZSTD</code> the default compression method for the <code>--compress</code> option.  * <code>--compress</code> produces <code>\\*.zst</code> files. You can specify <code>ZSTD</code> compression level with the <code>--compress-zstd-level=#</code> option.  * <code>--compress=lz4</code> produces <code>\\*.lz4</code> files. You can extract the contents of these files by using <code>lz4</code> program.  You can extract the contents of the files by using the <code>--decompress</code> option. To decompress backups taken by older versions of Percona XtraBackup that used a QuickLZ compression algorithm, the <code>--decompress</code> option still supports <code>qpress</code> for backward compatibility.

The <code>quicklz</code> algorithm is chosen by default. When using <code>--compress=quicklz</code> or <code>--compress</code> , the resulting files have the qpress archive format. Every <code>\\*.qp</code> file produced by xtrabackup is essentially a one-file qpress archive and can be extracted and uncompressed by the <code>qpress</code> file archiver.  * <code>--compress=zstd</code> produces <code>\\*.zst</code> files. You can specify <code>ZSTD</code> compression level with the <code>[--compress-zstd-level=#</code>](#compress-zstd-level) option.  * <code>--compress=lz4</code> produces <code>\\*.lz4</code> files.

To compress files using the ZSTD compression algorithm, set the <code>--compress</code> option to zstd. The <code>--compress=zstd</code> option produces <code>*.zst</code> files.

MySQL 8.0.29 extended the support for <code>ALGORITHM=INSTANT</code> to allow columns to be added to any position in a table and column drops. Older versions of Percona XtraBackup are incompatible with MySQL 8.0.29 because of this new functionality.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>MySQL 8.0.29 extended the support of the <code>ALTER TABLE \u2026 DROP COLUMNS</code> statement to use <code>ALGORITHM=INSTANT</code>. These operations only modify the metadata in the data directory and do not affect the physical structure. The <code>ALGORITHM=INSTANT</code> is the default setting for supported <code>DDL</code> operations. Prior to MySQL 8.0.29, an <code>ALGORITHM=INSTANT</code> column could only be added as the last table column. As of MySQL 8.0.29, the column can be added to any table position. The ability to add or drop a column in any position increases the complexity of crash recovery since the redo log does not have the logical positions from the data dictionary. The redo log contains the physical order for the table.</p> <p>Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.29-21 contains fixes for these issues. Percona XtraBackup 8.0.29 can backup and restore tables that used the <code>INSTANT</code> algorithm in ADD/DROP in Percona Server for MySQL.
